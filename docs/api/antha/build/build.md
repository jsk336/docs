Package build gathers information about Go packages.


### Go Path

The Go path is a list of directory trees containing Go source code. It is
consulted to resolve imports that cannot be found in the standard Go tree. The
default path is the value of the GOPATH environment variable, interpreted as a
path list appropriate to the operating system (on Unix, the variable is a
colon-separated string; on Windows, a semicolon-separated string; on Plan 9, a
list).

Each directory listed in the Go path must have a prescribed structure:

The src/ directory holds source code. The path below 'src' determines the import
path or executable name.

The pkg/ directory holds installed package objects. As in the Go tree, each
target operating system and architecture pair has its own subdirectory of pkg
(pkg/GOOS_GOARCH).

If DIR is a directory listed in the Go path, a package with source in
DIR/src/foo/bar can be imported as "foo/bar" and has its compiled form installed
to "DIR/pkg/GOOS_GOARCH/foo/bar.a" (or, for gccgo,
"DIR/pkg/gccgo/foo/libbar.a").

The bin/ directory holds compiled commands. Each command is named for its source
directory, but only using the final element, not the entire path. That is, the
command with source in DIR/src/foo/quux is installed into DIR/bin/quux, not
DIR/bin/foo/quux. The foo/ is stripped so that you can add DIR/bin to your PATH
to get at the installed commands.

Here's an example directory layout:

    GOPATH=/home/user/gocode

    /home/user/gocode/
        src/
            foo/
                bar/               (go code in package bar)
                    x.go
                quux/              (go code in package main)
                    y.go
        bin/
            quux                   (installed command)
        pkg/
            linux_amd64/
                foo/
                    bar.a          (installed package object)


### Build Constraints

A build constraint, also known as a build tag, is a line comment that begins

    // +build

that lists the conditions under which a file should be included in the package.
Constraints may appear in any kind of source file (not just Go), but they must
appear near the top of the file, preceded only by blank lines and other line
comments. These rules mean that in Go files a build constraint must appear
before the package clause.

To distinguish build constraints from package documentation, a series of build
constraints must be followed by a blank line.

A build constraint is evaluated as the OR of space-separated options; each
option evaluates as the AND of its comma-separated terms; and each term is an
alphanumeric word or, preceded by !, its negation. That is, the build
constraint:

    // +build linux,386 darwin,!cgo

corresponds to the boolean formula:

    (linux AND 386) OR (darwin AND (NOT cgo))

A file may have multiple build constraints. The overall constraint is the AND of
the individual constraints. That is, the build constraints:

    // +build linux darwin
    // +build 386

corresponds to the boolean formula:

    (linux OR darwin) AND 386

During a particular build, the following words are satisfied:

    - the target operating system, as spelled by runtime.GOOS
    - the target architecture, as spelled by runtime.GOARCH
    - the compiler being used, either "gc" or "gccgo"
    - "cgo", if ctxt.CgoEnabled is true
    - "go1.1", from Go version 1.1 onward
    - "go1.2", from Go version 1.2 onward
    - "go1.3", from Go version 1.3 onward
    - any additional words listed in ctxt.BuildTags

If a file's name, after stripping the extension and a possible _test suffix,
matches any of the following patterns:

    *_GOOS
    *_GOARCH
    *_GOOS_GOARCH

(example: source_windows_amd64.go) or the literals:

    GOOS
    GOARCH

(example: windows.go) where GOOS and GOARCH represent any known operating system
and architecture values respectively, then the file is considered to have an
implicit build constraint requiring those terms.

To keep a file from being considered for the build:

    // +build ignore

(any other unsatisfied word will work as well, but ``ignore'' is conventional.)

To build a file only when using cgo, and only on Linux and OS X:

    // +build linux,cgo darwin,cgo

Such a file is usually paired with another file implementing the default
functionality for other systems, which in this case would carry the constraint:

    // +build !linux,!darwin !cgo

Naming a file dns_windows.go will cause it to be included only when building the
package for Windows; similarly, math_386.s will be included only when building
the package for 32-bit x86.

## Usage

```go
var ToolDir = filepath.Join(runtime.GOROOT(), "pkg/tool/"+runtime.GOOS+"_"+runtime.GOARCH)
```
ToolDir is the directory containing build tools.

#### func  ArchChar

```go
func ArchChar(goarch string) (string, error)
```
ArchChar returns the architecture character for the given goarch. For example,
ArchChar("amd64") returns "6".

#### func  IsLocalImport

```go
func IsLocalImport(path string) bool
```
IsLocalImport reports whether the import path is a local import path, like ".",
"..", "./foo", or "../foo".

#### type Context

```go
type Context struct {
	GOARCH      string // target architecture
	GOOS        string // target operating system
	GOROOT      string // Go root
	GOPATH      string // Go path
	CgoEnabled  bool   // whether cgo can be used
	UseAllFiles bool   // use files regardless of +build lines, file names
	Compiler    string // compiler to assume when computing target paths

	// The build and release tags specify build constraints
	// that should be considered satisfied when processing +build lines.
	// Clients creating a new context may customize BuildTags, which
	// defaults to empty, but it is usually an error to customize ReleaseTags,
	// which defaults to the list of Go releases the current release is compatible with.
	// In addition to the BuildTags and ReleaseTags, build constraints
	// consider the values of GOARCH and GOOS as satisfied tags.
	BuildTags   []string
	ReleaseTags []string

	// The install suffix specifies a suffix to use in the name of the installation
	// directory. By default it is empty, but custom builds that need to keep
	// their outputs separate can set InstallSuffix to do so. For example, when
	// using the race detector, the go command uses InstallSuffix = "race", so
	// that on a Linux/386 system, packages are written to a directory named
	// "linux_386_race" instead of the usual "linux_386".
	InstallSuffix string

	// JoinPath joins the sequence of path fragments into a single path.
	// If JoinPath is nil, Import uses filepath.Join.
	JoinPath func(elem ...string) string

	// SplitPathList splits the path list into a slice of individual paths.
	// If SplitPathList is nil, Import uses filepath.SplitList.
	SplitPathList func(list string) []string

	// IsAbsPath reports whether path is an absolute path.
	// If IsAbsPath is nil, Import uses filepath.IsAbs.
	IsAbsPath func(path string) bool

	// IsDir reports whether the path names a directory.
	// If IsDir is nil, Import calls os.Stat and uses the result's IsDir method.
	IsDir func(path string) bool

	// HasSubdir reports whether dir is a subdirectory of
	// (perhaps multiple levels below) root.
	// If so, HasSubdir sets rel to a slash-separated path that
	// can be joined to root to produce a path equivalent to dir.
	// If HasSubdir is nil, Import uses an implementation built on
	// filepath.EvalSymlinks.
	HasSubdir func(root, dir string) (rel string, ok bool)

	// ReadDir returns a slice of os.FileInfo, sorted by Name,
	// describing the content of the named directory.
	// If ReadDir is nil, Import uses ioutil.ReadDir.
	ReadDir func(dir string) (fi []os.FileInfo, err error)

	// OpenFile opens a file (not a directory) for reading.
	// If OpenFile is nil, Import uses os.Open.
	OpenFile func(path string) (r io.ReadCloser, err error)
}
```

A Context specifies the supporting context for a build.

```go
var Default Context = defaultContext()
```
Default is the default Context for builds. It uses the GOARCH, GOOS, GOROOT, and
GOPATH environment variables if set, or else the compiled code's GOARCH, GOOS,
and GOROOT.

#### func (*Context) Import

```go
func (ctxt *Context) Import(path string, srcDir string, mode ImportMode) (*Package, error)
```
Import returns details about the Go package named by the import path,
interpreting local import paths relative to the srcDir directory. If the path is
a local import path naming a package that can be imported using a standard
import path, the returned package will set p.ImportPath to that path.

In the directory containing the package, .go, .c, .h, and .s files are
considered part of the package except for:

    - .go files in package documentation
    - files starting with _ or . (likely editor temporary files)
    - files with build constraints not satisfied by the context

If an error occurs, Import returns a non-nil error and a non-nil *Package
containing partial information.

#### func (*Context) ImportDir

```go
func (ctxt *Context) ImportDir(dir string, mode ImportMode) (*Package, error)
```
ImportDir is like Import but processes the Go package found in the named
directory.

#### func (*Context) MatchFile

```go
func (ctxt *Context) MatchFile(dir, name string) (match bool, err error)
```
MatchFile reports whether the file with the given name in the given directory
matches the context and would be included in a Package created by ImportDir of
that directory.

MatchFile considers the name of the file and may use ctxt.OpenFile to read some
or all of the file's content.

#### func (*Context) SrcDirs

```go
func (ctxt *Context) SrcDirs() []string
```
SrcDirs returns a list of package source root directories. It draws from the
current Go root and Go path but omits directories that do not exist.

#### type ImportMode

```go
type ImportMode uint
```

An ImportMode controls the behavior of the Import method.

```go
const (
	// If FindOnly is set, Import stops after locating the directory
	// that should contain the sources for a package.  It does not
	// read any files in the directory.
	FindOnly ImportMode = 1 << iota

	// If AllowBinary is set, Import can be satisfied by a compiled
	// package object without corresponding sources.
	AllowBinary
)
```

#### type NoGoError

```go
type NoGoError struct {
	Dir string
}
```

NoGoError is the error used by Import to describe a directory containing no
buildable Go source files. (It may still contain test files, files hidden by
build tags, and so on.)

#### func (*NoGoError) Error

```go
func (e *NoGoError) Error() string
```

#### type Package

```go
type Package struct {
	Dir         string   // directory containing package sources
	Name        string   // package name
	Doc         string   // documentation synopsis
	ImportPath  string   // import path of package ("" if unknown)
	Root        string   // root of Go tree where this package lives
	SrcRoot     string   // package source root directory ("" if unknown)
	PkgRoot     string   // package install root directory ("" if unknown)
	BinDir      string   // command install directory ("" if unknown)
	Goroot      bool     // package found in Go root
	PkgObj      string   // installed .a file
	AllTags     []string // tags that can influence file selection in this directory
	ConflictDir string   // this directory shadows Dir in $GOPATH

	// Source files
	GoFiles        []string // .go source files (excluding CgoFiles, TestGoFiles, XTestGoFiles)
	CgoFiles       []string // .go source files that import "C"
	IgnoredGoFiles []string // .go source files ignored for this build
	CFiles         []string // .c source files
	CXXFiles       []string // .cc, .cpp and .cxx source files
	MFiles         []string // .m (Objective-C) source files
	HFiles         []string // .h, .hh, .hpp and .hxx source files
	SFiles         []string // .s source files
	SwigFiles      []string // .swig files
	SwigCXXFiles   []string // .swigcxx files
	SysoFiles      []string // .syso system object files to add to archive

	// Cgo directives
	CgoCFLAGS    []string // Cgo CFLAGS directives
	CgoCPPFLAGS  []string // Cgo CPPFLAGS directives
	CgoCXXFLAGS  []string // Cgo CXXFLAGS directives
	CgoLDFLAGS   []string // Cgo LDFLAGS directives
	CgoPkgConfig []string // Cgo pkg-config directives

	// Dependency information
	Imports   []string                    // imports from GoFiles, CgoFiles
	ImportPos map[string][]token.Position // line information for Imports

	// Test information
	TestGoFiles    []string                    // _test.go files in package
	TestImports    []string                    // imports from TestGoFiles
	TestImportPos  map[string][]token.Position // line information for TestImports
	XTestGoFiles   []string                    // _test.go files outside package
	XTestImports   []string                    // imports from XTestGoFiles
	XTestImportPos map[string][]token.Position // line information for XTestImports
}
```

A Package describes the Go package found in a directory.

#### func  Import

```go
func Import(path, srcDir string, mode ImportMode) (*Package, error)
```
Import is shorthand for Default.Import.

#### func  ImportDir

```go
func ImportDir(dir string, mode ImportMode) (*Package, error)
```
ImportDir is shorthand for Default.ImportDir.

#### func (*Package) IsCommand

```go
func (p *Package) IsCommand() bool
```
IsCommand reports whether the package is considered a command to be installed
(not just a library). Packages named "main" are treated as commands.
