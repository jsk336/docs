	  <code-explainer-info sec="imports" bullet="1" label="Import elements">
	    The Antha Element starts by defining a name for the protocol, in this case bradford, and listing what additional protocols or Go libraries are needed to execute the bradford protocol. The Antha compiler is smart enough to identify whether the imports are existing Go libraries, or other Antha Elements, and can be transparently imported directly from source code repositories such as Github.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="parameters" bullet="2" label="Parameters">
	    The Parameters block defines the information inputs to the Bradford Element. Data types can be any of the built-in types from the Go language, such as int, string, byte, float, as well as the strongly typed scientific types introduced by the Antha language, such as the metric units.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="data" bullet="3" label="Data">
	    The Data block defines the information outputs from the Bradford Element. Declaration follows the same format as the Parameters block, although no default values are given.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="inputs" bullet="4" label="Inputs">
	    The Inputs block defines the physical inputs to the protocol, along with their appropriate type. For example, in this block, all the types are WaterSolutions, meaning they can be operated on by a standard liquid handling robot, or manual pipette operations. Additional attributes of the physical samples are used by the Antha Execution system to plan the optimal way to perform physical actions such as mixing on samples based on their types.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="outputs" bullet="5" label="Outputs">
	    This protocol is a destructive protocol, meaning that all of the intermediates and the final sample created as a result of this assay needs to be destroyed after performing the protocol. However, many protocols also output a physical sample, such as a new liquid solution containing DNA, enzymes, or cells.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="requirements" bullet="6" label="Requirements">
	    The Requirements block is executed by a protocol before it begins work, to allow confirming the state of any inputs. For example, a test like require(!Sample.Expired()) would explicitly confirm that the input sample had not, for the information on the type of sample available to the Antha system, expired by being left outside of a temperature controlled environment for too long.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="setup" bullet="7" label="Setup">
	    The Setup block is performed once the first time that an Element is executed. This can be used to perform any configuration that is needed globally for the Element, and is also used to define any special setup that may be needed for groups of concurrent tasks that might be executed at the same time. Any variables that need to be accessed by the Steps function globally can be defined here as well, but need to be handled with care to avoid concurrency problems. 
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="steps" bullet="9" label="Steps">
	    The heart of an Antha Element is the Steps block, which defines the actual steps taken to transform a set of input parameters and samples into the output data and samples. The Steps are a kernel function, meaning they share no information for every concurrent sample that is processed, and define the workflow to transform a single block of inputs and samples into a single set of outputs, even if the Element is operating on an entire array (such as micro-titre plate of samples at once). 
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="analysis" bullet="10" label="Analysis">
	    The Analysis block defines how the results of the Steps can should be transformed into final values, if appropriate. Computing the final protein concentration of a Bradford assay requires having the data back from the control samples, performing a linear regression, and then using those results to normalize the plate reader results.
	  </code-explainer-info>
	  <code-explainer-info sec="validation" bullet="11" label="Validation">
	    The Validation block allows the definition of specific tests to verify the correct execution of an Element, along with reporting capabilities (and the ability to declare the execution a failure). For example, the Bradford assay can only handle a specific linear range of concentrations, so if the amount of protein in the sample is above or below that range, the assay will fail.
